	abstract = {"Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of artificial intelligence as a serious science and engineering discipline. Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents is a textbook aimed at junior to senior undergraduate students and first-year graduate students. It presents artificial intelligence (AI) using a coherent framework to study the design of intelligent computational agents. By showing how basic approaches fit into a multidimensional design space, readers can learn the fundamentals without losing sight of the bigger picture. The book balances theory and experiment, showing how to link them intimately together, and develops the science of AI together with its engineering applications. Although structured as a textbook, the book's straightforward, self-contained style will also appeal to a wide audience of professionals, researchers, and independent learners. AI is a rapidly developing field: this book encapsulates the latest results without being exhaustive and encyclopedic. It teaches the main principles and tools that will allow readers to explore and learn on their own. The text is supported by an online learning environment, AIspace, http://aispace.org, so that students can experiment with the main AI algorithms plus problems, animations, lecture slides, and a knowledge representation system, AIlog, for experimentation and problem solving"--Provided by publisher},

Individuals are grouped into different groups according to their ages (tree size). The competitions between individuals are limited in the same groups. That prevents the structure editing operators from destroying the continuity of the evolution.

This will enable more remote and extreme environments such as deep ocean and other planets to be studied, leading to signiﬁcant science discoveries. This paper presents an approach to extend the high level autonomy of robots by enabling them to model and reason about scientiﬁc knowledge on-board. We achieve this by using Bayesian networks to encode scientiﬁc knowledge and adapting Monte Carlo Tree Search techniques to reason about the network and plan informative sensing actions. The resulting knowledge representation and reasoning framework is anytime, handles large state spaces and robust to uncertainty making it highly applicable to ﬁeld robotics. We apply the approach to a Mars exploration mission in which the robot is required to plan paths and decide when to use its sensing modalities to study a scientiﬁc latent variable of interest. Extensive simulation results show that our approach has signiﬁcant performance beneﬁts over alternative methods. We also demonstrate the practicality of our approach in an analog Martian environment where our experimental rover, Continuum, plans and executes a science mission autonomously.},

In the last few years several researchers have focused on the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Classic SLAM approaches are passive in the sense that they only process the perceived sensor data and do not inﬂuence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper we present a novel and integrated approach that combines autonomous exploration with simultaneous localization and mapping. Our method uses a grid-based version of the FastSLAM algorithm and at each point in time considers actions to actively close loops during exploration. By re-entering already visited areas the robot reduces its localization error and this way learns more accurate maps. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches lacking the ability to actively close loops.},

After training the deep neural network on a series of thousands of randomly-generated “dungeon maps”, the predicted optimal sensing action can be computed in constant time, with prospects for appealing scalability in the testing phase to higher dimensional systems. We evaluated the performance of deep neural networks on the autonomous exploration of two-dimensional workspaces, comparing several different neural networks that were selected due to their success in recent ImageNet challenges.

However, energy and time constraints limit how often these sensors can be used in a mission. Robots are also equipped with cheaper to use navigation sensors such as cameras. In this paper, we explore a challenging planning problem in which a robot is required to learn about a scientiﬁc variable of interest in an initially unknown environment by planning informative paths and deciding when and where to use its sensors. To tackle this we present two innovations: a Bayesian generative model framework to automatically learn correlations between expensive science sensors and cheaper to use navigation sensors online, and a sampling based approach to plan for multiple sensors while handling long horizons and budget constraints. Our approach does not grow in complexity with data and is anytime making it highly applicable to ﬁeld robotics. We tested our approach extensively in simulation and validated it with real data collected during the 2014 Mojave Volatiles Prospector Mission. Our planning algorithm performs statistically signiﬁcantly better than myopic approaches and at least as well as a coverage-based algorithm in an initially unknown environment while having added advantages of being able to exploit prior knowledge and handle other intricacies of the real world without further algorithmic modiﬁcations.},

This may mean that there are adversarial agents in the environment trying to disable the robots, or that some regions of the environment tend to make the robots fail, for example due to radiation, ﬁre, adverse weather, or caustic chemicals. A probabilistic model of the environment is formulated, under which recursive Bayesian ﬁlters are used to estimate the environment events and hazards online. The robots must control their positions both to avoid sensor failures and to provide useful sensor information by following the analytical gradient of mutual information computed using these online estimates. Mutual information is shown to combine the competing incentives of avoiding failure and collecting informative measurements under a common objective. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {Robots are increasingly being utilized in unstructured environments. Autonomous mobile robots are being assigned with tasks that are either too difficult or too dangerous for people. For instance, search and rescue robots can be deployed in unstable environments to aid in the search for disaster victims. In this paper, we propose a novel design for an autonomous mobile robot that can dynamically adjust traction during runtime. Our device, called Adabot meaning adaptive robot, is small, has a simple design, and can extend wegs from its wheels by adjustable amounts. We optimize both the morphology and the control parameters of Adabot using differential evolution, and our simulation results show that Adabot is effectively able to take advantage of both purely wheeled locomotion and legged-wheel locomotion by transitioning automatically between these two modes.},

The unique gearing configuration that facilitates these dual capabilities is described, and testing quantifies that this nonprecision gearing system is roughly 81\% efficient in a worst-case scenario of loading. This work introduces the Tri-Wheel concept and provides preliminary testing to validate its predicted operating characteristics.},

We present the design by dynamic similarity technique and the locomotion adaptations which have allowed for this highly dynamic performance. In addition, we demonstrate that rotational dynamics become critical for stability as the scale of a robotic system is reduced. We present a new method of experimental dynamic tuning for legged millirobots, aimed at finding stable limit cycles with minimal rotational energy. By implementing an aerodynamic rotational damper, we further reduced the rotational energy in the system, and demonstrated that stable limit cycles with lower rotational energy are more robust to disturbances. This method increased the stability of the system without detracting from forward speed.},

In this work, we take inspiration from these organisms to design, fabricate, and control a 10cm, 24 gram underactuated hexapedal robot capable of running at 14 body lengths per second and performing dynamic turning maneuvers. Our design relies on parallel kinematic mechanisms fabricated using the scaled smart composite microstructures (SCM) process and viscoelastic polymer legs with tunable stiffness. In addition to the novel robot design, we present experimental validation of the lateral leg spring (LLS) locomotion model's prediction that dynamic turning can be achieved by modulating leg stiffness. Finally, we present and validate a leg design for active stiffness control using shape memory alloy and demonstrate the ability of the robot to execute near-gymnastic 90° turns in the span of five strides.},

We present the results a simulation study suggesting that appropriate mechanical and control alterations to the template result in fast stable climbing that preserves the characteristic body motions and foot forces found in the template model and in animals. These design changes should also allow the robot to operate with commercially available actuators and in the same power to weight range as other running and climbing robots.},

At the origin of Holland’s work, LCSs were seen as a model of the emergence of cognitive abilities thanks to adaptive mechanisms, particularly evolutionary processes. After a renewal of the field more focused on learning, LCSs are now considered as sequential decision problem-solving systems endowed with a generalization property. Indeed, from a Reinforcement Learning point of view, LCSs can be seen as learning systems building a compact representation of their problem thanks to generalization. More recently, LCSs have proved efficient at solving automatic classification tasks. The aim of the present contribution is to describe the state-of- the-art of LCSs, emphasizing recent developments, and focusing more on the sequential decision domain than on automatic classification.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a significant breakthrough in research on solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Where past solvers could not scale beyond perhaps a dozen states, modern solvers can handle complex domains with many thousands of states. This breakthrough was mainly due to the idea of restricting value function computations to a finite subset of the belief space, permitting only local value updates for this subset. This approach, known as point-based value iteration, avoids the exponential growth of the value function, and is thus applicable for domains with longer horizons, even with relatively large state spaces. Many extensions were suggested to this basic idea, focusing on various aspects of the algorithm—mainly the selection of the belief space subset, and the order of value function updates. In this survey, we walk the reader through the fundamentals of point-based value iteration, explaining the main concepts and ideas. Then, we survey the major extensions to the basic algorithm, discussing their merits. Finally, we include an extensive empirical analysis using well known benchmarks, in order to shed light on the strengths and limitations of the various approaches.},
