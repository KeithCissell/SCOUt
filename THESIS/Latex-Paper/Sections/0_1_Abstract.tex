  The purpose of this project is to create an artificially intelligent "mind" to make observational decisions for a mobile robot.
  The mobile robot will have a set of sensors with which it can survey its surrounding environment. It will store this observed data, perform an analysis and plan its next move accordingly.
  The plan is to drop a robot into unfamiliar environments with a set goal to achieve and let it learn on its own the best way to approach the given situation.
  Usages can be as simple as mapping out an unknown area, to as difficult as searching for survivors after a natural disaster.
  The robot will have internal and external limitations it must work with such as battery life and terrain obstacles.
  The goal is to create AI that can learn how to use its observational skills to achieve a goal within a dynamic environment.
