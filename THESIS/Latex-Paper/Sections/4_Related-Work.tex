\todo{Reword/Expand}
To begin my process, I read various research papers on autonomous vehicle exploration.
The key point I extracted from my readings were the various proposed tasks and situations that were being solved by autonomy.
From these proposed tasks, I was able to put together a broad perspective of use cases and begin to draw parallels between them all.
My end goal is to create an abstracted process for goal-oriented robots regardless of what their specific tasks were, the environment they were in, and the means in which they gathered their data.
I found these were the three cornerstones of goal-oriented robotics: given task, environmental obstacles to handle, and given capabilities.
This semesterâ€™s work lays out the foundation for my research in the possibility and ease for this three dimensional problem to be abstracted.
