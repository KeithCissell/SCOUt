This chapter covers a few ideas for future work that could improve upon the current state of the SCOUt project.

\noindent
\textbf{Artificial Neural Network Integration.}
Original ideas for the adaptive control schema included the use of an artificial neural network (ANN).
The ANN would take an agent state and a list of valid actions as input and output the selected action.
Due to the dynamic nature of agent states, use of an ANN was ruled out.
If an agent changes the sensors it is equipped with, the ANN would need to account for a new set of input values due to the different set of \texttt{ElementState}s that would be found in the \texttt{AgentState}.
However, the memory-based approach required the use of several weights to guide each state comparison and action scoring equation.
Our solution was to optimize the weight set using a genetic algorithm (GA).
Use of an ANN in place of the state comparison equations would eliminate the need for external weights to be provided.
This could further enhance the adaptability of SCOUt's decision model.
State-action pairs (SAPs) could be compared against the current state by passing attributes through the ANN to output difference scores.
The ANN could be trained with backpropagation using the existing simulation platform and the short-term and long term-reward systems.
This model would likely require the ANN to remain ``open'' in the sense that its weights are constantly being trained during every operation.

\noindent
\textbf{Improved Memory Management.}
Improvements to both the process of saving and loading the SCOUt controller's memory could be made.
For saving memory, the application of cluster would cut down on memory storage requirements.
Currently, SCOUt saves the last 20 SAPs from each operation, and uniformly samples 5 percent of the remaining SAPs.
Instead of only saving a sub-set, all SAPs could be saved in memory and a data clustering algorithm could later be applied to ``clean-up'' the memory.
The clusters could then be averaged and given a weight based on the number of SAPs that fell within the cluster.
This would eliminate redundancies within the memory set, as well as reduce the amount of computational time required for the controller to conduct state comparisons.
As for loading memory, an adaptive approach could be taken to select only a sub-set of the SAPs to use in each operation.
The controller could begin by analyzing the given goal and agent setup to choose SAPs from memory that correlate to the operation at hand.
We expect that this would have two positive effects: less memory means less computational time for the action decision model, and a more concise memory set would yield higher performance results.

\noindent
\textbf{Integration of Goals into Agent States.}
Currently, the only place that we see the reflection of the current goal in SCOUt's decision model is with the \texttt{indicator} flag found in each \texttt{ElementState}.
A higher-level approach could be taken so that the decision model analyzes an \textit{OperationState} rather than just an \texttt{AgentState}.
This could be achieved by classifying the goal type and goal instance.
For example, a \textit{Find Human} \textit{OperationState} would also include a current goal type of ``anomaly searching'' and a goal instance of ``human'' since this is the specific anomaly that the agent is searching for.
These attributes could then be weighted into the state comparison system to produce a more concise \textit{OverallStateDifference} score.
