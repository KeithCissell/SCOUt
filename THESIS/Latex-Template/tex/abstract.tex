      The use of autonomous robotics in the field of exploration has drastically expanded with innovations in both hardware technology and the applications of artificial intelligence (AI).
      A wide variety of robotic agents and the environments that they can operate within has led to the creation of many unique control schemas that cater to each specific agent and their goal within an environment.
      Most control schemas must be built from the ground up for each given operation. Here we discuss a single, adaptive control solution for autonomous exploration across multiple agent setups, goals, and environments.
      The control schema utilizes a memory-based reinforcement-learning approach to efficiently analyze agent states for planning actions to safely navigate an environment and collect data to achieve a defined goal.
      The control schema was first tested in simulation against random and heuristic control schemas to compare performance.
      Next the controller was tested in simulation with alterations to the agent’s sensors, environments, and goals to observe adaptability.
      Performance comparisons are made for each controller’s goal completion, number of actions taken, and the remaining health and energy of the agent controlled.
      Results indicate that this control schema is both useful and adaptable to new situations.
      An adaptive control schema, such as the one presented in this research, could help provide a universal solution for building autonomous robots in the field of exploration.
