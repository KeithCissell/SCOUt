I would like to thank the entire Computer Science department at Missouri State University, specifically my committee members, Dr. Anthony Clark, Dr. Lloyd Smith, and Dr. Kenneth Vollmar.
A special thanks to Dr. Anthony Clark for advising and assisting me every step of the way, I truly could not have accomplished this without him.

I dedicate this paper to my parents who have always encouraged me to strive for greatness.
Their support in both my life and quest for knowledge cannot be put into words.
