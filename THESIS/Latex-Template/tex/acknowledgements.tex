I would like to thank the entire Computer Science Department at Missouri State University, specifically my committee members, Dr. Anthony Clark, Dr. Lloyd Smith, and Dr. Kenneth Vollmar.
A special thanks to Dr. Anthony Clark for advising and assisting me every step of the way, I truly could not have accomplished this without him.

I dedicate this paper to my parents, David and Susan, who have always encouraged me to strive for greatness.
Their support in both my life and quest for knowledge cannot be put into words.
