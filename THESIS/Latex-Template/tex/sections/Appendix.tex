\tocless\section{Training Variation 1} \label{sec:training_variation1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\thesection. Training Variation 1}
This appendix contains results for my first variation of training the three SCOUt controller memories ($SCOUt_{FH}$, $SCOUt_{MW}$, and $SCOUt_{H}$).
During training and iteration testing, the long-term reward (algorithm~\ref{algorithmic:long_term_reward}) was adjusted to only factor in a \texttt{goalReward} if the agent had remaining health at the end of an operation.
This was done to observe how SCOUt controllers would change the agent's behavior when their memory of state-action rewards reflected smaller long-term rewards from operations where the agent's health was depleted.
It was hoped that better performance would be seen in average remaining energy and subsequently all other areas.
However, no significant improvements in performance were found.
Appendix~F1 shows the results for $SCOUt_{FH}$, Appendix~F2 shows the results for $SCOUt_{MW}$, and Appendix~F3 and Appendix~F4 show results for $SCOUt_{H}$ in \textit{Find Human} and \textit{Map Water} operations, respectively.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\thesection. Training Variation 2}
This appendix contains results for my second variation of training the three SCOUt controller memories ($SCOUt_{FH}$, $SCOUt_{MW}$, and $SCOUt_{H}$).
During training and iteration testing, the \textit{goalRewardWeight} used for calculating long-term reward (algorithm~\ref{algorithmic:long_term_reward}) was set to 1.5.
This was done to observe how SCOUt controllers would change the agent's behavior when their memory of state-action rewards reflected a stronger emphasis on the level of goal completion attained.
It was hoped that better performance would be seen in all categories.
While only slight improvements were observed, this method was chosen for all testing conducted in the experimentation.
Appendix~G1 shows the results for $SCOUt_{FH}$, Appendix~G2 shows the results for $SCOUt_{MW}$, and Appendix~G3 and Appendix~G4 show results for $SCOUt_{H}$ in \textit{Find Human} and \textit{Map Water} operations, respectively.
